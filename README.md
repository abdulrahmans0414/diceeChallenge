# Dicee Challenge

Welcome to Dicee Challenge! This is a simple web-based dice game where two players can roll dice, and the player with the higher number wins. This project is a part of my web development learning journey and serves as a fun way to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## How to Play

1. Click the **Roll Dice** button to roll the dice for both players.
2. The dice images will update to show the numbers rolled by each player.
3. The player with the higher number wins the round. If both players roll the same number, it's a draw.
4. Enjoy the game and have fun challenging your friends!
